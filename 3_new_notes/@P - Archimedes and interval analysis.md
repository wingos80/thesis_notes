## Context

I was reading Erik's PhD thesis about interval analysis.

## Note

Archimedes worked on estimating the circumference of a circle, he placed upper and lower bounds on the length by circumscribing and inscribing a circle with a regular polygon, who's perimeter is known analytically. So by increasing the number of sides of these scribing polygons more and more, it is possible to approach the value of pi.
