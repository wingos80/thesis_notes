# 2nd literature review

The first literature review focused on getting a broad overview of what flight control related RL MSc research has been conducted in the past. As the thesis project is to apply RL for flight control of the Flying-V, it is also important to gain a grasp of **a)** the development history of the Flying-V,  **b)** the flight control properties of the Flying-V, and **c)** any special characteristics of the Flying-V that warrants special attention from the flight control system.

The list of literature reviewed in this batch are as follows:

1. *Simon van Overeem*: Modelling and Handling Assessment of the Flying-V Aircraft

While the gathered literature all pertain to flying wing, it is important to note that the Flying-V is a special kind of flying wing due to its' high sweep angle, distinguishing it from more rectangular wing flying wing planforms; it is also shaped like a V instead of a Delta, distinguishing it from the delta flying wing planforms. An implication of this distinction is that flight control and handling properties specific to the Flying-V can conceivably not be observed in other flying wing designs, and vice-versa.
