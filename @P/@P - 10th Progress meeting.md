## Context

progress meeting notes with erik jan, expected results till this meeting is implemented and 95% finished work on eligibility traces, and almost made up mind about citation vs flying-V

## Note

Hand forced by legal to choose btwn v or c, choosing c.

Prep notes for meeting:

- Found it very difficult to replicate the alpha tracking results which casper had for the citation. List of ppl who used elevator inversion as fault:
	- Stefan, but for pitch rate tracking
	- Casper, for alpha tracking
	- 
- literature study feedback?
- should i try CAPS?
- should the goal of research be to find something better? Or to simply explore the unexplored
- why do you think people focused on drl/offline rl and then had the online algo as the cherry on top?


2 prong approach for data analysis/algorithm comparison:

grid of n (maybe 9) hparam for fair comparison

best hparams for some combinations
