## Context

Trying to learn MPC and fuzzy logic by following the course in my masters: Mathematical and human-inspired decision

## Note

## lecture 1

- slide 12, why is the cost function made up of the summed stage cost and then a terminal cost? Why is the terminal cost not just another summand inside the stage cost summation?
	- Ah i think its because the terminal cost does not need to factor in control action as a cost variable?
