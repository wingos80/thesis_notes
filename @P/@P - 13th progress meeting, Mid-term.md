## Context

Mid-term meeting for thesis with erik-jan.

## Note

- can we guarantee that we have the defense on the 30th of august?
- talk about the policy color plots
	- linear or nonlinear ??
- Is it worthwhile to make a comparison controller and then compare mine to it? Given that i do not have excellent robust PID control synthesize skills, or the time to learn it, given that i know *some* robust control skills, is it worthwhile/useful?
- journal and conference paper?
- discuss literature study and mid-term results
- what do you think so far about my work, my thesis, and me in general
- ADP algorithm is actually the LQR algorithm?
- how suitable am i for phd?
