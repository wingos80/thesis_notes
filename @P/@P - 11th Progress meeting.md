## Context

11th weekly progress meeting for masters thesis, expected results is:
- implemented accumulating trace
- implemented replacing trace
- implemented multistep

i implemented multistep but it's performance is actually worse than vanilla, so maybe there's something wrong??

## Note
- talk about new research objectives
- talk about literature review
- talk about potential for doing this optimization-problemification thing
- what is aerospace research central and why does delft and other big universities not have a subscription for it.

### William after 
- question 2a needs grounding...
- shift cg modelled wrong
- run shifted cg from start
- clustering could be cool
