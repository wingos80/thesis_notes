## Context

Explain what you were thinking about before or surrounding this idea, perhaps how this is related to the thesis, to work...

## Note

- last meeting i had no time to make a progress report because i actually started a part-time job in a startup.
- what universities might i find interesting research in RL, perhaps specifically in RL for flight control?
- remember the forms for momi progress for incase graduation will happen after 31st aug?
- plagiarism scanner scan before sending draft for greenlight
- what are all the forms:
	- AE-3(a,b,c) forms
	- rush to reserve room on greenlight day
- find all the sources i cited and save them all in one folder!!!
- what i think is a fundamental issue of RL: more data eventually inevitably leads to better agent, and more data usually means longer learning, but we want agents that can learn quickly.
