## Context

Watching the week 4.1b lectures video C on uncertainty quantification by Richard Dwight.

## Note

Ultimately, there are 5 ways of describing a random variable:

1. X: a mapping from the sample space to the real number space. Essentially, the random variable itself.
2. pdf: probability density function
3. cdf: cumulative density function
4. samples: realisations of the random variable.
5. moments: 

It is interesting that there exists routes that allow one to traverse from one description to another. But **fundamentally**, they are all ways of describing X, the random variable in question.
