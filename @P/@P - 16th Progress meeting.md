## Context

Last progress meeting for the technical phase of research phase 2

## Note

- if you suddenly had to get a new job, and were able to instantly get any job you want at any company, which company would you go for.
- what is the cns website and why is this the only section with a seperate website
- why is there a systems and control section at me and then a control and simulations section here at ae
- sherpa: tell me a little bit more about what it is, doesnt need to be perfect, i just want to hear a five minute intro from you about what this is


- last meeting i said the algorithm runs in 30 seconds, i actually kind of lied and rounded down the number, the usual time is more like 50 seconds -_-
- funny note, long time ago me and my friend would joke about how we stay in research or academia because once in a while we get this big dopamine boost from good results, and because of this boost we act almost like addicts and keep grinding at research just to feel that dopamine hit again.
- check progress report 14 and go over which questions are important
- i should only make a presentation for the final defense not for the go no go meeting right?




- dont forget about observations versus mdp state space
- run with rate saturation
- need to define threshold for success and then calculate success ratio and stuff
- points for recoomendatoins:
	- no rate lmits, maybe add
	- discussion on mdp state space
	- increment inputs
	- 
- continuous adaptive critic flight control aided with approximated plant dynamics
