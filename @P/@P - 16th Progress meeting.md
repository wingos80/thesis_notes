## Context

Last progress meeting for the technical phase of research phase 2

## Note

- if you suddenly had to get a new job, and were able to instantly get any job you want at any company, which company would you go for.
- last meeting i said the algorithm runs in 30 seconds, i actually kind of lied and rounded down the number, the usual time is more like 50 seconds -_-
- funny note, long time ago me and my friend would joke about how we stay in research or academia because once in a while we get this big dopamine boost from good results, and because of this boost we act almost like addicts and keep grinding at research just to feel that dopamine hit again.
- check progress report 14 and go over which questions are important
- i should only make a presentation for the final defense not for the go no go meeting right?
