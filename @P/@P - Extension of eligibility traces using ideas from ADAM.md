## Context

Looking over differences between eligibility and momentum. While they are different in how they use previous TD errors, their algorithms are potentially amenable to the same improvements...

## Note

Looking at [[@Q - Eligibility trace vs momentum]], it is clear eligibility traces are better than momentum approaches. However, this does not stop from using augmentations made on momentum optimizers, such as Adam, Ada prop, Rms prop... to eligibility traces.

So I should learn how Adam and these other SGD optimizers work first, and then see if they could be applied to eligibility traces.
