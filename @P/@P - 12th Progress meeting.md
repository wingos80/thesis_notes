## Context

Weekly thesis progress meeting with Erik-Jan van Kampen. Expected results are correctly implemented MIDHP and eligibility traces, several pages of content written for mid-term report, further hyperparameter Monte Carlo run to increase seed number to 500, best found hyperparameter ran for all 4 flight cases, nearly converged set of research question (work hard!).

## Note

- ask about what are some possible areas for improvement in my thesis or current work.
- ask about preliminary thesis structure:
	- I'd like to include some of the tests i ran to decide on design of the idhp algorithm. Specifically, the varying hidden layer size, the varying network inputs/mdp states, and most importantly hyperparameter tuning. I realize that including these sections would make my preliminary report longer than usual, but i feel they are (in varying degrees) important to the thesis. I want to get your comment on including these parts before i go ahead and write them into the preliminary thesis. 
	- Equation variables, if i want to say "where x is ..., y is ..., z is ...", is it best practice to write these before or after an equation?
- Is the range of cessna citation elevator deflection -20,20 inclusive or exclusive?
