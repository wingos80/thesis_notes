## Context


## Note

- About journal, i would like to submit to a journal, can we talk about it.
	- can i submit to a conference, and then submit to a journal?
- I feel like there isn't really a big difference between RL control and adaptive control (adaptive back stepping, adaptive INDI), is it fine to acknowledge this similarity and state that this research is limiting the scope to considering improving RL based control for the sake of improving it? E.g., what are the effective differences between INDI and Incremental Backstepping?
- line in the sand for success ratio: maybe i shouldn't even be considering success ratios. Maybe there's a better way of quantifying performance of controllers. 
- i want to use normalized errors, but i am finding it hard to decide how to normalize my errors, i know the idea is to use normalization to get the errors to be roughly ranging from 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 etc, but if i do that then there will still be outliers which really skew the normalization range
- what is scientific significance, what should i be thinking about when someone says scientific significance, what should i be understanding from that word, or what is it's definition. I think i know how i would define it, but i don't know how other people including you would define this word.
- is INDI invented at delft
