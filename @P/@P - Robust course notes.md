## Context

Following the robust course to tie up some loose strings in understanding.

## Note

he says "high gain" but is it not possible to tackle that issue through penalizing control action (matrix R)?

further question, i understand ultimately there is some aspect of lqr that makes it not "robust", and you mention that the issue of "hgih gain" 

can you elaborate a little on what you mean by "limited connection to practical performance requirements"?


could you elaborate more on margins at "input" vs "output"

what are the consequence of margin at input, or how do i interpret margin at input?

slide 51 of ppt 3.2: LQR, adaptive dynamic algorithms? Yeah looks very similar, sounds like the policy iteration algorithm. For further information refer to page 403 of stevens2016 book. So RL is optimal control haha :))
