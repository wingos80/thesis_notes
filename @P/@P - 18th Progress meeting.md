## Context


## Note

- We can observe improvements in most metrics in most cases whether we use rate saturation or not. For consistency with previous research, i chose to use the no rate saturation to be put and discussed on the paper, and then rate saturation results will be discussed in the additional results sections (if i have time).
- Weird result with A values
	- Any distance metric which you are aware of which i can use? I thought about KL Divergence and these kinds of divergences but im unsure how to implement them/couldn't find implementations online
- Where do people get the citation picture for their covers from, or how do other people make their covers
- How to form the committee?
- Thesis chapters and paper sections to be completed:
	- paper:
		- results and discussion
		- conclusion
	- thesis report:
		- introduction
		- additional results
		- conclusion
		- recommendations
- List of things to show in additional results:
	- scatter plot of hparams
	- rate vs non rate saturated
	- network Jacobian derivation
	- verification & validation, verification = making sure i have built the right thing (system meets specified requirements) (Are you building it right?), validation = making the the thing does what i want it to do (system serves intended purpose) (Are you building the right thing?).
		- verify controller implementation?
		- verify DASMAT dynamics between python and matlab match
		- cite the paper w citation specs for rate and deflection saturation limits


- make sure mystudyplanning ects accepted   **DONE**
- body of text send for the colour plots, to get a second set of eyes to see if the texts do a good job at describing the policy colour plots.   **DONE**
- improvements to the paper:  **DONE**
	- text in fig 3 and/or time in table 3  **DONE**
	- add colour coding for the four algos in table 4  **DONE**
- plagiarism scanner scan before sending draft for greenlight
- what are all the forms:
	- AE-3(a,b,c) forms
	- rush to reserve room on greenlight day
