## Context

Wanted to find sources using coefficient of variation exactly the way which Alexei explained it during his ABMSAT lectures, so i emailed him asking for such a source. He sends me this paper...
## Resource

DOI: 10.18564/jasss.2897

From paragraph 2.4 onwards, this paper talks about using coefficient of variation. The paper uses the following equation to decide on the minimum sample size needed for an ABM study is:

$$n_{min}=argmax_{n}|C^{x,n}_v−C^{x,m}_v|<E,\quad \forall x \ \& \ \forall m>n$$

In words, you should get enough samples until the change in $C_v$ falls below some threshold: exactly what Alexei taught in the lectures.
