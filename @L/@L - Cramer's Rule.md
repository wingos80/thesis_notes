## Context

Reading Cramer's rule as explained by Coen in his slides. Didn't make sense to me

## Resource

This link uses Cramer's rule most correctly. Cramer's rule is a linear algebra theorem stating how to find the solution for a linear system of equations. In the control or systems theory context, it allows for a state space model (permitted to be MIMO) to be converted to a system of transfer functions and vice versa.
