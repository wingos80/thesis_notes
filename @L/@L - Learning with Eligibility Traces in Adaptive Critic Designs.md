## Context

This paper was one of 3 papers sent to me from Erik-Jan after our discussion on the similarities between eligibility traces and momentum based gradient descent. It presents 2 slightly murky equations on momentum and eligibility, but has a good text explaining their difference.

## Resource

doi: 10.1109/ICVES.2006.371605.

This paper also shows that the difference between eligibility and momentum is what TD errors are used.

The interesting material here is this table, which shows eligibility augmentation has a higher successful training rate for its agents which converge faster.
